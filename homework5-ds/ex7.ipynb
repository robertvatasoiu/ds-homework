    "    1. Download the data\n",
    "    2. Visualise the data\n",
    "    3. (If needed) clean, normalise, transform and visualise the data to get a feeling about potential relationships between the variables\n",
    "    4. Try to find the most relevant features (feature selection)\n",
    "    5. Try to create new features (think PCA, SVD, other dimensionality reduction techniques)\n",
    "    6. Create multiple clusters (think about the Elbow method for Kmeans)\n",
    "    7. Select the number of clusters that you think is best to group the texts"
